<h3>The Purpose</h3>
<p>This project is a representation of the skills I have obtained during my bootcamp. The homepage is of a project created in the first six weeks of the bootcamp, with a few adjustments made. Including translating the original code from strictly JavaScript, to using the React library along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The About Me page highlights my professional summary, as well as gives viewers a visual of who I am with a picture of myself. The fun fact page highlights using an API to fetch data and display the results of a search.</p>
